  Over 50% of Earnest's cosigned loan applicants lived together and attemped to complete the 2-player application on 1 device. Given the product didn't
  support this behavior, **>30% experienced issues** completing their application in this way. I set out to design a flow to accomodate this behavior
  and give these users a smoother experience.
