company: Earnest
type: Web app
scope: Sole **Product Designer**, working closely with a Product Manager, UX Researcher, Visual Designer, and team of 6 Engineers.
tools:
metrics: Launched Q2 2021. In its first season, captured over $2.6M in volume with a conversion rate 40% higher than our other flows.

background: Earnest is a technology-enabled student loan lender and refinancer.
challenge: >
  Over 50% of Earnest's cosigned loan applicants lived together and attemped to complete the 2-player application on 1 device. Given the product didn't
  support this behavior, **>30% experienced issues** completing their application in this way. I set out to design a flow to accomodate this behavior
  and give these users a smoother experience.

        <h3>Parents needed to be able to select and apply for the right loan</h3>

        <div class="">
          <p>To meet an unmet need in education financing and to capture additional volume via a partnership agreement, Earnest wanted to launch a
            new Parent Loan product. With the addition of this new loan, users would have a total of 3 types to pick from. In order to ensure that
            users were able to select the right type of loan for them and apply for the Parent Loan when that was the best option, <strong>I needed to both
            redesign our top of funnel for all of our applications and design a smooth application for Parent Loans</strong>.

        <h3>An MVP to Build Upon</h3>

        <div class="">
          <p>Due to marketing partnership dependencies, the timeline for the Parent Loan project was relatively short. With that in mind, we focused
            on delivering an MVP that was able to direct applicants to the best loan for them and, should they choose a parent loan, make
            it a quick and simple application process. <strong>To cut down on engineering cost, I relied heavily on existing patterns and components</strong>
            that were already in production across our existing products and focused on developing an architecture that would meet our needs without
            adding scope.

        <h3>Understanding why parents take out Parent Loans</h3>

        <div class="">
          <p>Given that we were launching a new loan product, we wanted to have a strong understanding of why parents took Parent Loans,
            particularly over cosigning a Student Loan. We conducted a round of exploratory research, interviewing 10 parents:
            5 who took Parent Loans, and 5 who cosigned a Student Loan after considering a Parent Loan. Based on these conversations
            we learned a couple key things:

        <h3>How might we make it easy for users to select the right loan for them?</h3>

        <div style="margin-bottom: 32px;">
          <p>In adding a new loan product to Earnest's offering, I needed to reassess and restructure the top of funnel of our applications to ensure
            that users were able to select and apply for the right loan. I outlined the personas that needed to be accounted for and explored some architectures
            for the top of funnel. We ultimately landed on the <strong>Two-Step as the best option</strong> to serve all personas (especially given the
            breakdown of the personas and additional engineering constraints).</p>

        <h3>Structuring the application to be quick and clear</h3>

        <p>In order to make the application quick and clear for the parents filling it out, I explored four different
           flow architectures with various form segmentations. Ultimately we decided to move forward with the <strong>Single Student Form</strong>
           architecture as it offered clarity with separate forms for each user, without fragmenting the experience too much.

        <h3>A successful launch and first season</h3>

        <div class="">
          <p>The parent loan product launched in June of 2021 and was a big success. It met our loan volume targets for the year and <strong>converted ~40%
            higher</strong> than our other application flows. The changes to the top of funnel likewise met the goal of not negatively impacting our other
            application flow conversion rates. Most importantly, Parents were able to cover the cost of their child's education
            in a way that they hadn't before.
