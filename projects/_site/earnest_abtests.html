        <h3>Understanding how student borrowers thought about adding a cosigner</h3>

        <div class="">
          <p>In order to understand what information student loan borrowers pay attention to and what they want to know when it comes to their student loans,
            I interviewed 8 loan borrowers, both in person and via Usertesting.com.
