  <p>Using quantitative data from Google Analytics and <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com">CrazyEgg<a/>, and qualitative data from Facebook ad and community interactions, I looked at how prospective customers were interacting with existing pages and copy. In order to measure this the success of this landing page, I A/B tested it against the existing landing page.</p>
  <span class="projdesc">What</span>
  <p>In this test, I came in with a couple of hypotheses. Messaging-wise, the old prospecting landing page described <i>what</i> Sense was, but didn't really address <i>why</i> a prospective customer should care about it. In creating this landing page, I really wanted to speak to the value propositions that Sense provides so that the prospective customer can viscerally understand how purchasing Sense will help them. After the value propositions, some information on how Sense works is displayed. This information is more descriptive than the previous page, and aims to show rather than tell, with app screenshots and an image of the monitor installed in an electrical panel.</p>
