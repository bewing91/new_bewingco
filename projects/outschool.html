          <p>Over the past few months, the Outschool Product team collected feedback from teachers and prospective teachers about the application process.
            After reviewing this feedback, we identified <strong>3 key pain points prospective teachers were experiencing</strong>:

          <h5>Job Stories</h5>
          In order to frame our understanding of users and our design explorations going forward, we developed a few job to be done stories:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>When prospective teachers are in the application process, they want to know where they are in the process so that they know when they'll be done with their application.</li>
            <li>When prospective teachers are waiting to be approved, they want to know how long reviewing an application takes so that they know when they'll get a response.</li>
            <li>When prospective teachers are waiting to be approved, they want to learn how to be a successful Outschool teacher so that they can hit the ground running when they're approved.</li>


            <li>When prospective teachers are applying to Outschool, they want [] so that they feel that their time applying is being well spent.</li>

        <h3>How might we make it easy for teachers to understand their application status and stay engaged while they wait?</h3>

        <div class="">
          <h5>New Flow: One main dashboard to guide teachers through the application process</h5>
          <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/outschool/after_flow.png" style="padding: 32px 0px; max-width: 100%;">
          <div>After exploring a number of options, we decided that <strong>a dashboard would be the best solution</strong> to the issues applicants were experiencing.
          A dashboard would give the applicant:
          <br /><br />

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Application status</strong> in a consistent place</li>
           <li><strong>Guiding information</strong> about next steps</li>
           <li><strong>Resources</strong> to engage with while waiting</li>
          </ul>
          While we explored embedding the background check to further simplify the flow, we ultimately decided an embedded form
          would complicated the interface and potentially hurt the user experience.

        <div class="projsubsection">
          <strong>To provide transparency, we created a status section</strong> at the top of the dashboard with an arrow visualization to make it easy for applicants to see where they were in the process.
          The copy, CTA, and status change based on the applicant's stage.
          <br /><br />
          <strong>To increase engagement, we created a resources section</strong> below the status where users can learn about Outschool and stay engaged while they wait.
          The colors were chosen to reflect a design pattern elsewhere in the Outschool site.

          <h5>Usability testing takeaways</h5>
          After a round of usability testing, we learned that users:
            <ul>
              <li>Found the arrow visualization confusing and didn't understand what stage they were in.</li>
              <li>Liked the resources provided but wanted to be able to take action based on their learnings.</li>

          <h5>Resulting improvements</h5>
          <strong>To improve clarity</strong> and better match an existing Outschool design pattern, we swapped the arrows out for a timeline.
          <strong>For greater interactivity</strong>, we added cards to enable applicants to make changes to the class they created earlier in the application process,
          and to schedule a call with an existing teacher.

        <h3>Final Version: Emphasized focal point</h3>
        <div class="projsubsection">
          Given that our primary goal was to reduce dropoff, and the status section is what guides applicants through the process, we decided that we needed to further emphasize it.
          <strong>To draw further attention to the status, we removed the colored backgrounds from the resource cards and increased the contrast of the status section by changing the background to white.</strong> We swapped out the illustrations to add back some visual interest to resources and maintain visual consistency with other parts of the site.

          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          Throughout the design process, we worked with the engineering and operations teams to ensure that the final design would be relatively easy to implement
          and would make an outsized impact on the Outschool experience.  Implementation of the new application status dashboard is planned for Q4 2019.
        </div>
          <h3>What's Next</h3>
          Outschool runs its team on bi-monthly cycles and as a result, the timeline for design of the dashboard was fairly tight. With more time, I would rethink the entire application process to make it a smoother, more welcoming experience.
          Currently, the applicant needs to fill out the application and then goes through the additional steps found in this dashboard. There's ample room to improve the user experience by further integrating this dashboard with the application itself.
