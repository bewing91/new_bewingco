challenge: >
  In order to grow their plaform, Outschool needed to increase the number of teachers.
  The current teacher application process lacked transparency and failed to engage applicants while they waited for things like background check to be processed.
  As a result, it had a high rate of dropoff. We were tasked with improving engagement and reducing dropoff.

      <p>I started by conducting some qualitative and quantitative research.
        I reviewed our database of customer testimonials and communications with customers within the company's online forums.
        I wanted to understand how customers themselves talked about the product and where they found value in it.
        I also reviewed comments to our Facebook ads to identify points of confusion with our current ad copy, landing page, and overall product.</p>
        <p>With an understanding of how customers and prospective customers thought about the product, I used Google Analytics and a scroll depth tracker called CrazyEgg to see how prospective customers were interacting with the current landing page and website.</p>
