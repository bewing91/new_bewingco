background: Outschool is an online learning and teaching marketplace that connects K-12 learners with teachers around the world.
challenge: >
  In order to grow their plaform, Outschool needed to increase the number of teachers.
  The current teacher application process lacked transparency and failed to engage applicants while they waited for things like background check to be processed, resulting in a 70% dropoff rate.
  We were tasked with improving engagement and reducing dropoff.

          <p>The current teacher application process moved prospective teachers between various screens on the Outschool website, emails, and third-party sites.

          <h3>Why are prospective teachers dropping off?</h3>
          <p>Over the past few months, the Outschool Product team collected feedback from teachers and prospective teachers about the application process.
            After reviewing this feedback, we identified 3 key pain points prospective teachers were experiencing:

          <h5>Job Stories</h5>
          In order to frame our understanding of users and our design explorations going forward, we developed a few job to be done stories:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>When prospective teachers are in the application process, they want to know where they are in the process so that they know when they'll be done with their application.</li>
            <li>When prospective teachers are waiting to be approved, they want to know how long reviewing an application takes so that they know when they'll get a response.</li>
            <li>When prospective teachers are waiting to be approved, they want to learn how to be a successful Outschool teacher so that they can hit the ground running when they're approved.</li>


            <li>When prospective teachers are applying to Outschool, they want [] so that they feel that their time applying is being well spent.</li>
