challenge: >
  Pillar wanted to better deliver on one of their key value propositions: helping users understand their student loan debt.
  I was tasked with redesigning the home screen's loan summary cards to make it easier for users to understand the metrics around their loan debt and to encourage
  better management of it.

        <h3>Understanding student loan borrowers' relationships to their loans</h3>

        <div class="projsubsection">
          <p>In order to understand what information student loan borrowers pay attention to and what they want to know when it comes to their student loans,
            I interviewed 8 loan borrowers, both in person and via Usertesting.com.
            <br /><br />
            Based on these conversations, I came away with a few <strong>key insights to inform my designs</strong>:

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4" style="padding-right: 40px; padding-bottom: 24px;">
              <div style="padding-bottom: 8px; color: #FF7B9D;"><strong>1. Optimization minded:</strong></div>
              Borrowers want to know how much interest is accruing and how to pay off loans efficiently to minimize it.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4" style="padding-right: 40px; padding-bottom: 24px;">
              <div style="padding-bottom: 8px; color: #FF7B9D;"><strong>2. Focus on wins:</strong></div>
              Borrowers find their payoff date demoralizing. They want to see what their effort has accomplished.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4" style="padding-right: 40px; padding-bottom: 24px;">
              <div style="padding-bottom: 8px; color: #FF7B9D;"><strong>3. Original balance is a footnote:</strong></div>
              Borrowers know their original loan balance and are not interested in it outside of the context of other metrics.
