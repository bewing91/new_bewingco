challenge: >
  In order to grow their plaform, Outschool needed to increase the number of teachers.
  The current teacher application process lacked transparency and failed to engage applicants while they waited for things like background check to be processed.
  As a result, it had a 70% dropoff for teachers during the application process. We were tasked with improving engagement and reducing dropoff.
