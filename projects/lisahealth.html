  Sense is a consumer hardware startup that makes and sells a smart home energy monitor.
  The vast majority of the company’s prospective customers came in via Facebook ads and then through a landing page, where prospective customers first learned more about the product.
  I was tasked with redesigning the landing page in order to keep prospective customers engaged and learning, and more efficiently convert traffic.
