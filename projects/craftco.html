  Craft is a platform that provides easy-to-access comprehensive and accurate information about companies.
  With information drawn from thousands of sources, it provides the “Source of Truth” for company data ranging from financial to operating to human capital information.
challenge: >
  Craft had an existing semi-responsive web app.
  They wanted to develop their first native iOS app to begin delivering additional value to their users and to expand their user base.
  We were tasked with identifying compelling use cases for one of their key demographics, salespeople, and designing an app to address those use cases.
