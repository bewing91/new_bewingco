  Craft is a platform that provides easy-to-access, comprehensive information about companies, from financial to operating to human capital data.
challenge: >
  Craft wanted to develop an iOS app to enable one of their key demographics, B2B salespeople, to better conduct research on the go.
  After conducting user research, we learned that there wasn't a need for this product, and instead identified improvements to the Craft Feed,
  a way to track updates about companies, to be the best way to deliver value to their users.

metrics: Craft's engineering team is implementing these changes in early Q4 2019.

          <h3>Understanding B2B salespeople's needs</h3>
          In order to understand the needs of the users, we conducted a series of 10 user interviews with B2B salespeople.
          Given that we were initially tasked with designing an iOS app, we were particularly interested in learning about their workflows and behaviors, and where (mobile vs desktop) they completed different activities.
          <br /><br />
          Based on these conversations, we came away with some <strong>key insights:</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
          <li>Salespeople prefer to conduct research on their desktops</li>
          <li>Salespeople monitor a list of companies and respond to updates about these companies</li>
          <li>Notification needs and preferences vary. Salespeople rarely need to respond immediately.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          After considering these insights and the Craft's goals and needs, we decided that <strong>improvements to Craft's new feed functionality would best create value for users and the business.</strong>

          <h3>Identifying usability problems</h3>
          <!-- <h3>Users struggle to follow companies and identify information about companies they do follow.</h3> -->
          To identify problems in the Craft feed, we conducted usability tests with 5 people.
          After uncovering a slew of issues in the current feed experience, we prioritized them using a 2x2 and plotted each problem based on ease of implementation and impact on the user.
          <br /><br />We came away with <strong>3 key problems to address</strong>:
          <br /><br />
          Users struggle to stay up-to-date on companies they care about.

          With Craft's existing design system in mind, we explored solutions to make finding companies to follow easier.
          <br /><br />Among the ideas we considered were merging the two searches into one, and adding clearer headers to improve clarity.

          </ul>
          <!-- To reduce confusion and enable users to easily follow companies, the searches were combined into one.
          The side search bar was removed, 'Follow' links were added to companies in the top search,
          and the suggested companies list was given a clear header.

          After sketching some options, we <strong>tested two designs further with 40 people on UsabilityHub.</strong>

          It became clear that <strong>the conversational style header was easiest to understand</strong>. It
           required less interpretation and processing while the button-like nature of the badge design
           led to some confusion.

          Craft's team was so excited about the changes that we made, that they moved them to the top of the roadmap
          and plan to implement them in early Q4 2019. Thanks to our use of Craft's existing design system, the changes
          are relatively easy to implement and thus have a potentially high ROI for the Craft platform.

        <h3>What's Next</h3>
        <div>In the course of our research, we identifed a number of usability issues with the current feed.
          While we were constrained by time and engineering considerations, there were a number of additional changes that I would make in order to deliver more value to users and the business.

          My top priority would be to add filtering functionality to the feed to make it even easier for users to find what they're looking for in the feed.
