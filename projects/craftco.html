  Craft is a platform that provides easy-to-access, comprehensive information about companies.
  It aims to serve as the “Source of Truth” for company data ranging from financial to operating to human capital information.
challenge: >
  Craft wanted to develop their first iOS app to enable one of their key demographics, B2B salespeople, to better conduct research on the go.
  After interviewing 10 salespeople, we learned that this wouldn’t fit into users’ workflows and thus wouldn’t deliver much value to them or the company.
  Based on our research, we identified improvements to the Craft Feed, a way to track updates about companies, to be the best way to deliver value to their users, both on-the-go and in their desktop-based work environment.

metrics: Improved Y by X%.

      <h6>Research</h6>
      <h3>Understanding B2B salespeople's needs</h3>
      In order to understand the needs of the users, we conducted a series of 10 user interviews with B2B salespeople.
      Given that we were initially tasked with designing an iOS app, we were particularly interested in learning about their workflows and behaviors, and where (mobile vs desktop) they completed different activities.
      <br /><br />
      Based on these conversations, we came away with some <strong>key insights:</strong>
      <br /><br />
      <ul>
      <li>Salespeople prefer to conduct research on their desktops</li>
      <li>Time-sensitive triggers are important</li>
      <li>Salespeople monitor a list of companies</li>
      <li>Notification needs and preferences vary</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      After considering these insights and the Craft's goals and needs, we decided that improvements to Craft's new feed functionality would best create value for users and the business.

      <h6>Identifying the problem</h6>
      <h3>Users struggle to follow companies and identify information about companies they do follow.</h3>

        <div class="col-md-6">
          To identify problems in the Craft feed, we conducted 5 usability tests.
          After uncovering a slew of issues in the current feed experience, we prioritized them using a 2x2 and plotted each problem based on ease of implementation and impact on the user.
          <br /><br />We came away with <strong>3 key problems to address</strong>:
          <br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li>Finding companies to follow is confusing.</li>

          <h5>Before</h5>
          The original feed page had two search bars: one in the top navigation bar and one on the right side of the feed content.
          <br /><br />The side search made it easy to follow companies from the page, but <strong>only 1/5 users</strong> we tested thought to search for a company with the side search rather than the top search.
          <br /><br />This resulted in users being taken away from the feed and having to spend time locating the follow button on a company's profile.

          <h5>Exploring solutions</h5>
          With Craft's existing design system and patterns in mind, we explored different solutions to make finding companies to follow easier.
          <br /><br />Among the ideas we considered were merging the two searches into one, and adding clearer headers to improve clarity.

          <h5>After</h5>
          I removed the side search to reduce confusion and in order to allow users to quickly and easily follow companies, added 'Follow' links to companies returned in the top nav search results.
          <br /><br />The rest of the side search card was given a clear header 'Suggested Companies' that shared the styling of the other side card headers.
