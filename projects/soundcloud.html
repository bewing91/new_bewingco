challenge: >
  Soundcloud is a music platform that makes it easy for artists to share their music and
  for fans to discover and listen to it. As a musician and avid music fan, it's important to me that discovery
  is the best it can be. With that in mind, I conducted a two week case study to uncover how might we
  make discovery easier on Soundcloud.

        <h5>Usability Testing</h5>
        <p>To identify painpoints in the app, I conducted 6 guerilla usability tests in the coffee shops of San Francisco.
        To test different aspects of the app, I asked each participant to complete a few tasks within the app.
        <br /><br />
        All of the people I tested were in their 20s and 30s, regularly listened to music and were familiar with Soundcloud.

        <h5>Synthesis & Analysis</h5>
        After the tests, I reviewed the recordings and notes that I had taken, and made note of points of frustration and confusion that people experienced while attempting to complete the tasks.
        <br /><br />
        I collected these insights on post-its and created an Affinity Map, grouping them into pain point themes like 'Search Filtering' and 'Navigating the Feed.'

      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h5>Prioritization</h5>
        In order to prioritize the pain points and decide which were most important to focus on, I mapped them on a 2x2 matrix based on user impact and level of effort for implementation.
        I wanted to identify which pain points, when addressed, would give Soundcloud the best bang for its buck with regards to impacting its user base and business.
        <br /><br />
        Given that Soundcloud's business model relies on subscription revenue from engaged users, I decided that in this case, user impact and business impact were closely aligned.

      <h5>Pain Points</h5>
      Prioritizing these pain points made it clear that users were struggling with discovery in Soundcloud, in three specific ways.

        <div class="painpt">
          <h6>Pain Point #1: Browsing content</h6>
          <p>Users found it difficult to browse for artists and other content.</p>

        <div class="painpt">
          <h6>Pain Point #2: Navigating the feed</h6>
          <p>Users struggled to understand the feed with ambiguous labeling like "Stream" and a lightning icon. Those that did found it frustrating to find new content from artists they follow, arguably one of the feed's key purposes.</p>

          <h6>Pain Point #3: Artist new releases</h6>
          <p>Users couldn't identify what was new on an artist's page.
             It wasn't clear to them how some sections were sorted, specifically the "Tracks" section.

  <h3>Ideate</h3>
  <div class="diverge">
    With the pain points identified, I began to explore the solution space. For each point, I sketched several potential solutions, keeping in mind common design patterns in use in Soundcloud and other popular apps.
    <br /><br />
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h6>Browsing content</h6>
        <br />
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/soundcloud/search_sketches_highlights.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h6>Navigating the feed</h6>
        <br />
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/soundcloud/feed_sketches_highlights.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h6>Artist new releases</h6>
        <br />
        <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/soundcloud/artist_sketches_highlights.png" style="max-width: 100%;">
      </div>
      <div>
        <br />
        <p>In deciding on solutions, I considered the ease of implementation and impact of each design.
          I tried to rely on existing design patterns in the Soundcloud app as much as possible to cut down on potential development time
          and ripple effects. Some ideas, like dropdown menus for search filtering, while I felt were one of the best options from a UX perspective,
          I decided against because they would have required introduction of a new pattern within the app, and I felt the pain point could be
          adequately solved through a filter overlay, which already existed elsewhere in the app.</p>

          In each case, I took elements from multiple sketches and combined them into what I thought maximized impact and minimized cost.
