              Craft is a platform that provides easy-to-access, comprehensive information about companies, from financial to operating to human capital data.

            <div id="challenge">
              <h5>The Challenge</h5>
              <p>Craft wanted to develop an iOS app to enable B2B salespeople to better conduct research on the go. After conducting user research, we learned there wasn’t a need for this and instead identified improvements to the Craft Feed, a way to track updates about companies, as the best way to deliver value to users.</p>

          <h5 style="color: #5E526A;">RESEARCH</h5>
          <h3>Understanding B2B salespeople's needs</h3>
          In order to understand the needs of the users, we conducted a series of 10 user interviews with B2B salespeople.
          Given that we were initially tasked with designing an iOS app, we were particularly interested in learning about their workflows and behaviors, and where (mobile vs desktop) they completed different activities.
          <br /><br />
          Based on these conversations, we came away with some <strong>key insights:</strong>
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Desktop over mobile</strong>: Salespeople prefer to conduct research on their desktops.</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor lists</strong>: Salespeople monitor a list of companies and respond to updates about these companies.</li>
          <li><strong>Important but not urgent</strong>: Notification needs and preferences vary. Salespeople rarely need to respond immediately.</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          After considering these insights and the Craft's goals and needs, we decided that <strong>improvements to Craft's new feed functionality would best create value for users and the business.</strong>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Identifying usability problems</h3>
          <!-- <h3>Users struggle to follow companies and identify information about companies they do follow.</h3> -->
          To identify problems in the Craft feed, we conducted usability tests with 5 people.
          After uncovering a slew of issues in the current feed experience, we prioritized them using a 2x2 and plotted each problem based on ease of implementation and impact on the user.
          <br /><br />We came away with <strong>3 key problems to address</strong>:
          <br /><br />
          <!-- Users struggle to stay up-to-date on companies they care about. -->

          Craft's team was so excited about the changes that we made, that they moved them to the top of the roadmap
          and implemented them in early Q4 2019. Thanks to our use of Craft's existing design system, the changes
          were relatively easy to implement and thus have a potentially high ROI for the Craft platform.

        <h3>What's Next</h3>
        <div>In the course of our research, we identifed a number of usability issues with the current feed.
          While we were constrained by time and engineering considerations, there were a number of additional changes that I would make in order to deliver more value to users and the business.

          My top priority would be to add filtering functionality to the feed to make it even easier for users to find what they're looking for in the feed.
