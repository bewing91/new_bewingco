          In order to frame our understanding of users and our design explorations going forward, we developed a few job to be done stories:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>When prospective teachers are in the application process, they want to know where they are in the process so that they know when they'll be done with their application.</li>
            <li>When prospective teachers are waiting to be approved, they want to know how long reviewing an application takes so that they know when they'll get a response.</li>
            <li>When prospective teachers are waiting to be approved, they want to learn how to be a successful Outschool teacher so that they can hit the ground running when they're approved.</li>


            <li>When prospective teachers are applying to Outschool, they want [] so that they feel that their time applying is being well spent.</li>

          <h5>New Flow: One main dashboard to guide teachers through the application process</h5>
          <img src="/img/outschool/after_flow.png" style="padding: 32px 0px; max-width: 100%;">
          <div>After exploring a number of options, we decided that <strong>a dashboard would be the best solution</strong> to the issues applicants were experiencing.
          A dashboard would give the applicant:
          <br /><br />

          <ul>
           <li><strong>Application status</strong> in a consistent place</li>
           <li><strong>Guiding information</strong> about next steps</li>
           <li><strong>Resources</strong> to engage with while waiting</li>
          </ul>
          While we explored embedding the background check to further simplify the flow, we ultimately decided an embedded form
          would complicated the interface and potentially hurt the user experience.

          Given that our primary goal was to reduce dropoff, and the status section is what guides applicants through the process, we decided that we needed to further emphasize it.
          <strong>To draw further attention to the status, we removed the colored backgrounds from the resource cards and increased the contrast of the status section by changing the background to white.</strong> We swapped out the illustrations to add back some visual interest to resources and maintain visual consistency with other parts of the site.

          <h3>Implementation</h3>
          Throughout the design process, we worked with the engineering and operations teams to ensure that the final design would be relatively easy to implement
          and would make an outsized impact on the Outschool experience.  Implementation of the new application status dashboard is planned for Q4 2019.
        </div>
          <h3>What's Next</h3>
          Outschool runs its team on bi-monthly cycles and as a result, the timeline for design of the dashboard was fairly tight. With more time, I would rethink the entire application process to make it a smoother, more welcoming experience.
          Currently, the applicant needs to fill out the application and then goes through the additional steps found in this dashboard. There's ample room to improve the user experience by further integrating this dashboard with the application itself.
