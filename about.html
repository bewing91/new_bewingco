        <h4>Hey, I’m Ben.</h4>

        <p>I’m a freelance Product Designer living in San Francisco. Before I was a designer, I studied engineering and worked in Product Management and Marketing at consumer startups. I spent enough time working with engineers and driving business metrics, that I can’t help but bring that frame of mind to the designs and experiences I build. I love designs that are intuitive, efficient and clean, and products that make a real impact on the human experience.
          <br /><br />When I’m not designing, I’m making music (still sort of designing), reading (sometimes about design) and spending as much time outside as I can (definitely not designing).
