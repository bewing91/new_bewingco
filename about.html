        <h4>Hey, I’m Ben.</h4>
        <h6>I’m a freelance Product Designer living in San Francisco.</h6>
        <p> Before I was a designer, I worked in Product Management and Marketing at various consumer startups.
          As a result, I bring a business mindset to my designs. I love designs that are intuitive, efficient and clean, and products that make a real impact on the human experience.
          <br /><br />When I’m not designing, I’m making music (still sort of designing), reading (sometimes about design) and spending as much time outside as I can (definitely not designing).
